# Code That Writes Code: Supercharge Your Nx Workspace with Generators and Executors

This is the repository for the "Code That Writes Code: Supercharge Your Nx Workspace with Generators and Executors" talk.

## Run demo app

install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

start project:

```bash
nx serve dc-fandom
```

## Run library generator

```bash
npx nx generate @kathrine0/k-tools:k-lib --image=batman.jpg --name=batman
```

## Run workspace generator

If you want to test workspace creation from preset, first publish the tools packages in the local npm registry.

After packages are available, run

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace my-workspace --preset=@kathrine0/k-tools
```

or

```bash
npx @kathrine0/create-workspace my-other-workspace
```

## Run custom executors

```bash
nx run k-tools:version-publish --specifier=<version>
```

```bash
nx publish-all --specifier=<version>
```

## Talk Abstract

Nx generators and executors can automate your workflow, eliminate boilerplate, and bring consistency to your monorepo. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to create custom generators that scaffold code, build powerful executors for running tasks, and integrate both seamlessly into your Nx workspace.
